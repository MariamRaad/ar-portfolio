The app/marker will only work with the pattern_black.patt (seen in pattern_black.png)

Because the app tries to track the marker. 
And when the pattern_blue.patt is embedded, the differences of the colors aren't enough.

Even though pattern_black.patt is in usage, the image with the blue border (e.g. fullMarker_blue.svg) still works (in the meaning of: can be tracked from the app) because it's similar to the black border.
